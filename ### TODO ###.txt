As of June 30th 2017...

Covar_ui is close to done:

- Some validation tests for amplitude covariance are still missing (for instance curved rays must be loaded to access it);
- Data stored in the UI (such as 'data', 'idata' or 'L') may not be consistent throughout the module;
- No tests were made on the interface for 3D grids;
- Modifying parameters should modify 'temp_grid' accordingly;
- Experimental covariance isn't implemented.

In order to successfully create a covariance model, some preliminary steps are required. First, on must create the model in database_ui 
and add at least one mog to it. The latter must have boreholes associated with it. Second, one should create the model's grid (N.B.: don't 
forget clicking on 'Done' on the grid editor). Finally, one must also indicate the arrival times for each of the traces from the manual_tt_ui
(which can be achieved easily by importing tt.dat). Every feature of covar_ui should then be accessible.

Random tasks:

- Model.getModelData seems to be missing supported types (for instance, 'tt' is supported, but 'amp' is missing). These exist in Model.m
  within the Matlab code;
- Model.getModelData also doesn't support an upper limit velocity ('vlim');
- All dependencies from object to object should be cleared once it refers to a deleted object. One should study how the 'relationships'
  are implemented between the Borehole, Mog, AirShots and Model classes in order to achieve this;
- Data management is not fully viable: whenever a stored class' attribute's name is modified, the database is deprecated, which
  is quite a problem. One could solve this issue by completing 'convert_database' from the module 'database', although this is neither urgent
  nor easy to do. Some resources on this subject might exist on the web.

Data management through SQLAlchemy has been fully implemented in database_ui and covar_ui, and the main submodules.
Some other modules still lack this implementation, though. One should consider close to every *.bh, *.mog, *.model and
*.air attributes deprecated if applied to a user interface. Those should be replaced by a call into the database by
the means of <module>.session.query(<Class>).

Be wary of the tools such as auto_create_scrollbar() and lay() in utils_ui, as they provide a way of reducing the
quantity of code for a specified task and improving readability.

Arguments unpacking is used thoroughly in covar_ui and utils_ui, so one should become comfortable with this functionality
of Python. The star ('*') is used to separate an iterable into different arguments. Therefore, 'print(*['a', 'b', 'c'])' reads
for the program as 'print('a', 'b', 'c')'.

The code is fully PEP 8 compatible, exception made for the extra spaces before and after operators and for lines too long,
which are ignored for the purpose of readability. (Full list of ignored errors: E202, E221, E241, E501, E722, E741)

Finally, one should refer to the TODO annotations for specific tasks. Those may require a better understanding of BhTomoPy, though.
